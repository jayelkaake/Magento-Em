            <ol>
                <li>Subject to Licensee's compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement
                and any applicable payment terms, Varien grants Licensee a non-transferable,
                non-assignable, non-sublicensable, worldwide license solely during the Term to use,
                modify and create derivative works in respect of the Software, solely for internal
                purposes, in accordance with the Software's technical documentation. Such license is
                limited to the maximum number of designated servers as approved in writing by Varien
                ("Designated Server") .
                </li>
                <li>In the event that Licensee's actual number of Servers of a particular Software
                license exceeds the licensed number of Designated Servers on such license, Licensee
                shall promptly provide Varien with written notice and pay Varien the fees required to
                license such additional Server(s) in accordance with the commercial terms set out in
                any applicable order form of Varien or a Varien-authorized reseller ("Magento Order
                Form").
                </li>
                <li>Licensee shall implement reasonable controls to ensure that it does not exceed the
                maximum number of licensed Servers of the Software. Varien reserves the right to audit
                Licensee's use of the Software during normal business hours and with reasonable notice
                and to include means within the Software to limit Licensee's use of the Software to the
                licensed number of Servers.
                </li>
                <li>Varien shall provide to Licensee an initial copy of the Software, including the
                associated technical documentation, for use by Licensee in accordance with this
                Agreement. Subject to Sections 1.1-1.3 above, Licensee is authorized to make a
                reasonable number of copies of the Software as it requires for purpose of exercising
                its rights under this Agreement.
                </li>
                <li>Licensee is authorized to use the Software on a single substitute or backup Server
                on a temporary basis without charge any time a Designated Server is inoperative due to
                a malfunction beyond the control of Licensee. Licensee may transfer the Software on a
                permanent basis to a single replacement Server without charge. Licensee agrees to
                provide Varien with written notice, including the Server type and operating system, of
                any such transfer to a backup or replacement Server within five (5) days after such
                transfer.
                </li>
                <li>Licensee acknowledges that portions of the Software are also freely available to
                the public under Varien's open source version of the Software, subject to certain
                conditions, with limited warranties and other limited assurances, and without service
                or support. As an express condition for the license granted hereunder, Licensee agrees
                that any use of such open source versions of the Software, whether used on a Production
                Service Instance or Non-Production Server Instance, shall be deemed use of the Software
                for purposes of the calculation of fees payable under the Agreement.

                fees due to Varien shall be due and payable within fourteen (14) days of the date of
                invoice and overdue payments shall bear interest at the lesser of one and one-half
                percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum rate allowed under applicable law. Licensee is
                responsible for all taxes concerning the Software and/or services, excluding taxes
                based on Varien's or authorized reseller's income.

            <strong>Title and Protection</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Varien (or its third party providers) retains title to all portions of the
                Proprietary Material and any copies thereof. Licensee agrees to maintain strict
                controls to ensure that such materials are treated confidentially and safeguarded with
                at least the same degree of care that it takes to protect its own information of a
                similar nature, which in no event shall be less than a reasonable degree of care, and
                shall not disclose the Proprietary Material to anyone other than those of its employees
                or consultants under nondisclosure obligations, having a need to know for purposes
                consistent with this Agreement. Licensee shall affix, to each full or partial copy of
                the Proprietary Materials or any portion thereof made by Licensee, all copyright and
                proprietary information notices as were affixed to the original. The obligations set
                forth in this Section shall survive termination of this Agreement.
                </li>
                <li>Licensee acknowledges that the Software includes certain open source and other
                third-party software which is governed by the applicable license terms thereof. A list
                of such software, as amended from time to time, including the links applicable to
                related license terms and conditions thereof is specified in the product release notes
                for each Software version. The use of such software bundled within the Software is
                subject to the provisions of such license agreements, and in the event of any
                contradiction between the provisions of this Agreement and the provisions of such
                applicable license agreement, the provisions of the applicable license agreement shall
                prevail solely with respect to such software products. Varien makes no indemnity with
                respect to any open source or third-party software included within the Software, and
                for greater clarity, the indemnity set out in Section 5 (Patent and Copyright
                Indemnity) below does not apply to any such software.
                </li>
                <li>If the Software is acquired by or on behalf of a unit or agency of the U.S.
                Government (the "<strong>Government</strong>"), the Government agrees that such product
                is "commercial computer software" or "commercial computer software documentation" and
                that, absent a written agreement to the contrary, the Government's rights with respect
                to such product are limited by the terms of this Agreement, pursuant to applicable FAR
                and/or DFARS and successor regulations.

            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Patent and Copyright Indemnity</strong>
            <p>
                Varien shall indemnify and defend Licensee against any claims that the Software
                infringes any United States patent or United States copyright; provided that Varien is
                given prompt notice of such claim and is given information, reasonable assistance and
                sole authority to defend or settle the claim. In the defense or settlement of the
                claim, Varien shall obtain for Licensee the right to continue using the Software,
                replace or modify the Software so that it becomes non-infringing while giving
                equivalent performance or, if Varien determines that such remedies are not reasonably
                available, remove the infringing portion of the Software, accept its return and refund
                the prorated portion of any prepaid but unused fees for the use or support of such
                Software license. Varien shall have no liability if the alleged infringement is based
                on a modification of the Software by anyone other than Varien; is based on use of the
                Software with one or more Servers not listed in a Magento Order Form; or is based on
                the use of the Software other than in accordance with the documentation. This Section 5
                states Varien's entire liability and Licensee's exclusive remedy for infringement.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Default and Termination</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>An event of default shall be deemed to occur if: (i) Licensee fails to perform any
                of its obligations under the Sections entitled "License Exclusions" or "Title and
                Protection"; or (ii) either party fails to perform any other material obligation under
                this Agreement and such failure remains uncured for more than thirty (30) days after
                receipt of written notice thereof.
                </li>
                <li>If an event of default occurs, the non-defaulting party, in addition to any other
                rights available to it under the law, may terminate this Agreement and all licenses
                granted hereunder by written notice to the defaulting party. Remedies shall be
                cumulative and there shall be no obligation to exercise a particular remedy.
                </li>
                <li>Within thirty (30) days after termination of the Software license or expiration of
                the Term, Licensee shall certify in writing to Varien that Licensee has ceased use of
                the Software and that all copies of the Software in any form, including partial copies
                within modified versions, have been destroyed.

                    terms and conditions of support purchased by Licensee from Varien. Varien does not
                    warrant that the Software will meet Licensee's requirements, that the Software will
                    operate in the combinations which Licensee may select for use, that the operation of
                    the Software will be uninterrupted or error-free, or that all error conditions will
                    be corrected. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION ALL SOFTWARE PROVIDED HEREUNDER IS

                    computer "worm," computer "time bomb," "Trojan horse," "back door," or malware) or
                    any blended or convergent combination thereof.

                herein are provided for convenience only and have no substantive effect on the
                construction of this Agreement. Except for Licensee's obligation to pay Varien, neither
                party shall be liable for any failure to perform due to causes beyond its reasonable
                control. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this Agreement
                shall be construed without such provision. The failure by a party to exercise any right
                hereunder shall not operate as a waiver of such party's right to exercise such right or
                any other right in the future. This Agreement may be amended only by a written document
                executed by a duly authorized representative of each of the parties. This Agreement may
