Except for a signed license agreement to use the Software: (i) This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement concerning Licensee's use of the 
Software; (ii) No purchase order, other ordering document or any hand written or typewritten text which purports to modify or supplement the

   1.   License
         1. Subject to Licensee’s compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any applicable payment terms, Varien grants 
         Licensee a non-transferable, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, worldwide license solely during the Term to use, modify and create 
         derivative works in respect of the Software, solely for internal purposes, in accordance with the Software's technical documentation. 
         Such license is limited to the maximum number of designated servers as approved in writing by Varien ("Designated Server") . 
      
         2. In the event that Licensee's actual number of Servers of a particular Software license exceeds the licensed number of Designated 
         Servers on such license, Licensee shall promptly provide Varien with written notice and pay Varien the fees required to license such 
         additional Server(s) in accordance with the commercial terms set out in any applicable order form of Varien or a Varien-authorized 
         reseller ("Magento Order Form").
         
         3. Licensee shall implement reasonable controls to ensure that it does not exceed the maximum number of licensed Servers of the 
         Software.  Varien reserves the right to audit Licensee's use of the Software during normal business hours and with reasonable notice and 
         to include means within the Software to limit Licensee's use of the Software to the licensed number of Servers.
         
         4. Varien shall provide to Licensee an initial copy of the Software, including the associated technical documentation, for use by 
         Licensee in accordance with this Agreement.  Subject to Sections 1.1-1.3 above, Licensee is authorized to make a reasonable number of 
         copies of the Software as it requires for purpose of exercising its rights under this Agreement.
         
         5. Licensee is authorized to use the Software on a single substitute or backup Server on a temporary basis without charge any time a 
         Designated Server is inoperative due to a malfunction beyond the control of Licensee.  Licensee may transfer the Software on a permanent
         basis to a single replacement Server without charge.  Licensee agrees to provide Varien with written notice, including the Server type 
         and operating system, of any such transfer to a backup or replacement Server within five (5) days after such transfer.
         
         6. Licensee acknowledges that portions of the Software are also freely available to the public under Varien's open source version of the 
         Software, subject to certain conditions, with limited warranties and other limited assurances, and without service or support. As an 
         express condition for the license granted hereunder, Licensee agrees that any use of such open source versions of the Software, whether 
         used on a Production Service Instance or Non-Production Server Instance, shall be deemed use of the Software for purposes of the 
         calculation of fees payable under the Agreement.

   2. License Exclusions
         1. Except as expressly authorized herein, Licensee shall not:

               1. use or deploy the Software on any Server in excess of the number of Designated Servers;
   
               2. distribute, sublicense, disclose, market, rent, lease, remote computing services, networking, batch processing or transfer to 
               any third party the Software or permit any person or entity to have access to the Software by means of a time sharing, remote 
               computing services, networking, batch processing, service bureau or time sharing arrangement;
   
               3. export the Software in violation of U.S. Department of Commerce export administration regulations.
   
         2. No license, right or interest in any Varien trademark, trade name or service mark is granted hereunder.

   3. Fees and Payment Terms

         Licensee shall pay Varien or its authorized reseller the fees specified by Varien. All fees due to Varien shall be due and payable 
         within fourteen (14) days of the date of invoice and overdue payments shall bear interest at the lesser of one and one-half percent 
         (1.5%) per month or the maximum rate allowed under applicable law.  Licensee is responsible for all taxes concerning the Software and/or 
         services, excluding taxes based on Varien's or authorized reseller's income. 

   4. Title and Protection
         1. Varien (or its third party providers) retains title to all portions of the Proprietary Material and any copies thereof.  Licensee 
         agrees to maintain strict controls to ensure that such materials are treated confidentially and safeguarded with at least the same 
         degree of care that it takes to protect its own information of a similar nature, which in no event shall be less than a reasonable 
         degree of care, and shall not disclose the Proprietary Material to anyone other than those of its employees or consultants under 
         nondisclosure obligations, having a need to know for purposes consistent with this Agreement.  Licensee shall affix, to each full or 
         partial copy of the Proprietary Materials or any portion thereof made by Licensee, all copyright and proprietary information notices as 
         were affixed to the original.  The obligations set forth in this Section shall survive termination of this Agreement.
         
         2. Licensee acknowledges that the Software includes certain open source and other third-party software which is governed by the 
         applicable license terms thereof. A list of such software, as amended from time to time, including the links applicable to related 
         license terms and conditions thereof is specified in the product release notes for each Software version. The use of such software 
         bundled within the Software is subject to the provisions of such license agreements, and in the event of any contradiction between the 
         provisions of this Agreement and the provisions of such applicable license agreement, the provisions of the applicable license agreement 
         shall prevail solely with respect to such software products. Varien makes no indemnity with respect to any open source or third-party 
         software included within the Software, and for greater clarity, the indemnity set out in Section 5 (Patent and Copyright Indemnity) 
         below does not apply to any such software.
         
         3. If the Software is acquired by or on behalf of a unit or agency of the U.S. Government (the “Government”), the Government agrees that 
         such product is “commercial computer software” or “commercial computer software documentation” and that, absent a written agreement to 
         the contrary, the Government’s rights with respect to such product are limited by the terms of this Agreement, pursuant to applicable 
         FAR and/or DFARS and successor regulations.
         
   5. Patent and Copyright Indemnity

         Varien shall indemnify and defend Licensee against any claims that the Software infringes any United States patent or United States 
         copyright; provided that Varien is given prompt notice of such claim and is given information, reasonable assistance and sole authority 
         to defend or settle the claim.  In the defense or settlement of the claim, Varien shall obtain for Licensee the right to continue using 
         the Software, replace or modify the Software so that it becomes non-infringing while giving equivalent performance or, if Varien 
         determines that such remedies are not reasonably available, remove the infringing portion of the Software, accept its return and refund 
         the prorated portion of any prepaid but unused fees for the use or support of such Software license.  Varien shall have no liability if 
         the alleged infringement is based on a modification of the Software by anyone other than Varien; is based on use of the Software with 
         one or more Servers not listed in a Magento Order Form; or is based on the use of the Software other than in accordance with the 
         documentation.  This Section 5 states Varien's entire liability and Licensee's exclusive remedy for infringement.
         
   6. Default and Termination
         1. An event of default shall be deemed to occur if: (i) Licensee fails to perform any of its obligations under the Sections entitled 
         "License Exclusions" or "Title and Protection"; or (ii) either party fails to perform any other material obligation under this Agreement 
         and such failure remains uncured for more than thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice thereof.
         
         2. If an event of default occurs, the non-defaulting party, in addition to any other rights available to it under the law, may terminate 
         this Agreement and all licenses granted hereunder by written notice to the defaulting party.  Remedies shall be cumulative and there 
         shall be no obligation to exercise a particular remedy.
         
         3. Within thirty (30) days after termination of the Software license or expiration of the Term, Licensee shall certify in writing to 
         Varien that Licensee has ceased use of the Software and that all copies of the Software in any form, including partial copies within 
         modified versions, have been destroyed.
         
   7. Warranty
         1. Warranty for Software.  Varien warrants for a single period of ninety (90) days commencing upon Varien’s electronic delivery of the 
         Software to Licensee that the Software will perform the functions described in the specifications contained in the documentation 
         provided with the Software.  Varien or its authorized reseller will undertake reasonable efforts to correct any reported error in 
         accordance with any terms and conditions of support purchased by Licensee from Varien.  Varien does not warrant that the Software will 
         meet Licensee’s requirements, that the Software will operate in the combinations which Licensee may select for use, that the operation 
         of the Software will be uninterrupted or error-free, or that all error conditions will be corrected.  EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION 
         ALL SOFTWARE PROVIDED HEREUNDER IS PROVIDED “AS IS”.
         
         2. Anti-Virus Precautions.  Varien represents that as of the date of delivery to Licensee of the Software Varien used reasonable, 
         commercially available anti-virus software to prevent the Software from containing any malicious code, commands, instructions, programs, 
         or other internal components (e.g., a computer “virus,” computer “worm,” computer "time bomb," “Trojan horse,” “back door,” or malware) 
         or any blended or convergent combination thereof.
         
         3. DISCLAIMER.  THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 7 ARE THE ONLY WARRANTIES MADE BY VARIEN WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE 
         PROVIDED BY VARIEN.  VARIEN MAKES NO OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR ARISING BY CUSTOM OR TRADE USAGE, AND, SPECIFICALLY, MAKES NO 
         WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  VARIEN'S EXPRESS WARRANTIES SHALL NOT BE ENLARGED, DIMINISHED OR 
         AFFECTED BY, AND NO OBLIGATION OR LIABILITY SHALL ARISE OUT OF, VARIEN RENDERING TECHNICAL OR OTHER ADVICE OR SERVICE IN CONNECTION WITH 
         THE SOFTWARE.
         
   8. Limitation of Liability
         1. LIABILITY EXCLUSIONS. NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL EXCLUDE OR LIMIT EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR (i) THE TORT OF FRAUD OR DECEIT 
         (ii) DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY SUCH PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE OR (iii) ANY OTHER LIABILITY WHICH CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED BY 
         APPLICABLE LAW.  SAVE FOR THE FOREGOING, NEITHER PARTY ACCEPTS AND HEREBY EXCLUDES ANY LIABILITY FOR LOSS OF OR DAMAGE TO LICENSEE’S 
         TANGIBLE PROPERTY OTHER THAN THAT CAUSED BY ITS NEGLIGENCE AND HEREBY EXCLUDES ANY OTHER LIABILITY FOR NEGLIGENCE ARISING PURSUANT TO 
         THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR: LOSS OF REVENUE; LOSS OF ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED 
         PROFITS; LOSS OF CONTRACTS; LOSS OF THE USE OF MONEY; LOSS OF ANTICIPATED SAVINGS; LOSS OF BUSINESS; LOSS OF OPPORTUNITY; LOSS OF 
         GOODWILL; LOSS OF REPUTATION; LOSS OF, DAMAGE TO OR CORRUPTION OF DATA; OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INDIRECT LOSS OR SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR 
         INCIDENTAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, WHERE SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE IS ALSO OF A CATEGORY OF LOSS OR DAMAGE ALREADY 
         LISTED) WHETHER FORESEEABLE OR UNFORESEEABLE, BASED ON CLAIMS OF LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER PARTY ARISING OUT OF ANY BREACH OR FAILURE OF 
         EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY CONDITIONS OR OTHER TERM, BREACH OF CONTRACT, MISREPRESENTATION, NEGLIGENCE, OTHER LIABILITY IN TORT, 
         FAILURE OF ANY REMEDY TO ACHIEVE ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, OR OTHERWISE.

         2. LIABILITY CAP.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE FORM (E.G., CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) IN WHICH ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE ACTION MAY BE BROUGHT, 
         IN NO EVENT WILL VARIEN OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES, RESTITUTION OR LOSSES, THAT EXCEED, IN THE AGGREGATE, FOR EACH 
         RESPECTIVE BREACH OR SERIES OF RELATED BREACHES, THE AMOUNT OF FEES RECEIVED BY VARIEN FOR THE SOFTWARE LICENSE IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH 
         PERIOD PRIOR TO THE DATE ON WHICH THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO SUCH DAMAGES OR LOSSES OCCURRED.              
         
   2. Support Services Terms and Conditions

         Varien will provide support services and Updates for the Software and any Varien Modifications in accordance with the terms and 
         conditions of support purchased by Licensee.

  10. Notices

         All notices shall be in writing and sent by first class mail or overnight mail (or courier), or transmitted by facsimile (if confirmed 
         by such mailing), to the addresses indicated on the first page of this Agreement, or such other address as either party may indicate by 
         at least ten (10) days prior written notice to the other party.  Notices to Varien shall be sent to the Contracts Administration 
         Department.

  11. Assignment

         Licensee may not assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of Varien; provided that such consent shall not be required for 
         assignment to a purchaser of all or substantially all of the assets or equity securities of Licensee.  Any prohibited assignment shall 
         be null and void.

  12. General

         This Agreement is made in and shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, excluding choice of law principles.  All 
         proceedings shall be conducted in English.  Venue for all proceedings shall be Los Angeles County, California.  The United Nations 
         Convention for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply.  The section headings herein are provided for convenience only and have 
         no substantive effect on the construction of this Agreement.  Except for Licensee's obligation to pay Varien, neither party shall be 
         liable for any failure to perform due to causes beyond its reasonable control.  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be 
         unenforceable, this Agreement shall be construed without such provision.  The failure by a party to exercise any right hereunder shall 
         not operate as a waiver of such party's right to exercise such right or any other right in the future.  This Agreement may be amended 
         only by a written document executed by a duly authorized representative of each of the parties.  This Agreement may be executed in 
         counterparts. 

  13. Definitions

         "Designated Server" shall mean the Server specified in a Magento Order Form with respect to a particular Software license.

         "Modifications" means any code developed by Licensee or any third party, including without limitation, configuration, integrations, 
         implementations, or localizations to the external layer of the core, baseline Software product.  The term "Modifications" excludes 
         Updates provided by Varien as part of Support Services.

         "Proprietary Material" means the Software, related documentation, and all parts, copies and modifications thereof, and any other 
         information, in whatever form, received by Licensee hereunder from Varien or its licensors, provided, however, such information shall 
         not be deemed Proprietary Material if it (a) is or becomes a part of the public domain through no act or omission of Licensee; or (b) 
         was in Licensee's lawful possession prior to the disclosure and had not been obtained by Licensee from Varien; or (c) is lawfully 
         disclosed to Licensee by a third party without restriction on disclosure; or (d) is independently developed by Licensee without 
         reference to or use of the Proprietary Material.

         "Server" means any physical or virtual server from which a single instance of the Software is accessed and used either for production 
         purposes ("Production Server Instance") or for non-production purposes, such as development, test, training and other non-operational 
         business transactions ("Non-Production Server Instance").  For the avoidance of doubt, if one physical or virtual server contains two 
         (2) instances of the Software, e.g., one Production Server Instance and one Non-Production Server Instance, then a Server license is 
         required for each of such instances.

         "Software" means Varien's proprietary e-commerce software solution known as the Magento™ Enterprise Edition, provided solely in source 
         code, including associated technical documentation, and all Updates thereof furnished to Licensee as part of Support Services.  Except 
         as otherwise specified herein, the term Software includes certain open source software programs described in Section 4.2.  "Software” 
         does not include any Modifications.

         “Term” means the period commencing upon Varien’s electronic delivery of the Software to Licensee and expiring on the date set out in a 
         Magento Order Form, unless extended by the mutual written consent of both parties.

         "Updates" means all published revisions and corrections to the printed documentation and corrections and new releases of the Software 
         which are generally made available to Varien's supported customers at no additional cost or for media and handling charges only.  
         Updates shall not include any options or future products which Varien sells separately.
